The furniture here was collected from the deserted houses in the neighborhood, including an old wooden bed, a few metal shelves, a couch made of coarse cloths, a vintage style wood dining table and kitchen counter, a few lockers and steel boxes on the floor. She spent most of her night time in the room and it is safe enough for her to survive from the unexpected disasters.",
